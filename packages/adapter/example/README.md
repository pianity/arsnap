# dApp Example Using the Adapter

This is a simple commented example demonstrating how to:

- Connect to ArSnap
- Manage the permissions of a dApp
- Display the user's active wallet's address
- Sign a message with the user's active wallet

## Run the Example

See [Getting Started](/README.md#getting-started) if you haven't built `arsnap` and `adapter` yet.

Run the following command to start the development server of the example:

```bash
yarn example
```

You can now open the URL printed by the command in your browser to try the example. You can also
edit [`index.ts`](/packages/adapter/example/index.ts) while the server is running, it will be
automatically reloaded.
